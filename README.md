## Featured Notebooks

### 1. Online Payment Fraud Detection (`online_payment_fraud_detection.ipynb`)

This notebook demonstrates a complete machine learning pipeline for detecting fraudulent online payment transactions. It's an excellent example of binary classification applied to a real-world problem in financial technology.


### 2. autoencoders using PyTorch (`autoencoder_hands_on.ipynb`)

This notebook provides a hands-on guide to understanding and implementing autoencoders using PyTorch. It includes the following sections:

1. Loading and preprocessing the MNIST dataset.

2. Designing and training a simple fully-connected autoencoder to reconstruct images.

3. Visualizing image reconstructions and exploring the latent space representations.

4. Extending the model to a denoising autoencoder, aimed at reconstructing clean images from noisy inputs.

5. Suggestions for further experimentation, such as using convolutional layers, adding sparsity penalties, or exploring variational autoencoders (VAEs).
